SPEAKER 1 0:00:00
Good morning, Lucy. How are you? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:02
Very well. Thanks. How about you? 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:05
I have a headache. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:06
Did you go to the doctor or take medicine? 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:09
I'm stuck with a new project. It makes me overthink. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:12
So the only cure is to get the job done. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:15
I know, but how to do it, I don't know. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:18
What project do I not know about? 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:20
I need to hire a company to write a sales website at a low cost. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:24
It's too simple. I will send you a list of software companies that have worked with our company. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:29
The bottom line is low cost. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:31
Then negotiate with them. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:33
The company that offers the lowest price has also three times the budget for the project. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:38
Maybe you should ask John. I think he can help. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:41
You're right. Let me call him. Hello John. How have you been? Well, a little crazy actually. Maybe someone needs to talk. I'm a bit busy. What are you doing calling me? I need your help on a low cost website project for the company. Wait a minute, I'll be right there. I thought you were busy. You're right, I need someone to talk to. Well then, talking in person is better than over the phone. Are you here too, Lucy? 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:12
I'm the one who mentioned you to Peter. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:14
You two are my saviors. I still don't understand what you mean. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:18
He needs to design a sales website for his company but cannot find it outsourced. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:23
It's not that I can't find it, it's that the budget is too low.  
SPEAKER 3 0:01:29
How much budget?
SPEAKER 1 0:01:31
Five thousand dollars.
SPEAKER 3 0:01:34
Not too low, you can create it with web creation software. The site is complex and needs programming. It's hard at that price. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:39
Why don't you ask for more budget? 
SPEAKER 3 0:01:41
I asked but was not accepted. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:43
Perhaps our company is in financial difficulty. 
SPEAKER 3 0:01:44
The company's finances are in good shape. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:49
Why be stingy with such an important project? 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:52
Our bosses are looking to save money.
